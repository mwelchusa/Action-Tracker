# Action-Tracker
Action Tracker

Application where you will be able to enter which actions for the day you'd expect to complete. You can choose additional tasks/actions you have completed such as going for a walk and how much time the action took. The app will track your overall time committed to each action over time.

Based on which actions you initially selected a number score will be associated with it by summing the task values. You will be able to assign overall amounts manually, the system will default by evenly splitting 100 points between all tasks (ex: 4 tasks each will have 25 points)

Additional tasks will have smaller values that you can manually control as well. 

Achieving your set tasks will earn you a graded A+ for the day. You will see this A+ in an animation during the beginning of the next day.

Completed OVER your set point total by completing all your tasks + additional tasks will earn you an S ranking

The system will track your highest score total
